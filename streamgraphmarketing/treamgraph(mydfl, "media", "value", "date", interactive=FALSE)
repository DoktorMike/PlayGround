     ‘streamgraph()’ initializes the streamgraph html widget and takes
     a data frame in "long" format with columns for the category (by
     default, it looks for ‘key’) and its associated ‘date’ and
     ‘value’. You can supply the names for those columns if they aren't
     named as such in your data.
     By default, interactivity is on, but you can disable that by
     setting the ‘interactive’ parameter to ‘FALSE’.

     streamgraph(data, key, value, date, width = NULL, height = NULL,
       offset = "silhouette", interpolate = "cardinal",

       bottom = 30, left = 50, sort = TRUE, complete = TRUE,
       order = c("compat", "asis", "inside-out", "reverse"))

    data: data frame

     key: bare or quoted name of the category column (defaults to
          ‘key’)

   value: bare or quoted name of the value column (defaults to ‘value’)

    date: bare or quoted name of the date column (defaults to ‘date’)

   width: Width in pixels (optional, defaults to automatic sizing)

  height: Height in pixels (optional, defaults to automatic sizing)

  offset: see d3's offset layout for more details. The default is
          probably fine for most uses but can be one of ‘silhouette’
          (default), ‘wiggle’, ‘expand’ or ‘zero’

interpolate: see d3's area interpolation for more details. The default
          is probably fine fore most uses, but can be one of ‘cardinal’
          (default), ‘linear’, ‘step’, ‘step-before’, ‘step-after’,
          ‘basis’, ‘basis-open’, ‘cardinal-open’, ‘monotone’

interactive: set to ‘FALSE’ if you do not want an interactive
          streamgraph

   scale: axis scale (‘date’ [default] or ‘continuous’)

     top: top margin (default should be fine, this allows for
          fine-tuning plot space)

   right: right margin (default should be fine, this allows for
          fine-tuning plot space)

  bottom: bottom margin (default should be fine, this allows for
          fine-tuning plot space)

    left: left margin (default should be fine, this allows for
          fine-tuning plot space)

    sort: experimental

complete: experimental

   order: streamgraph ribbon order. "`compat`" to match the orignial
          package behavior, "`asis`" to use the input order,
          "`inside-out`" to sort by index of maximum value, then use
          balanced weighting, or "`reverse`" to reverse the input layer
          order.
